          <div>
            <p>
              Pembrokeshire Woven Coffins was founded to offer families a meaningful
              alternative to mass-produced coffins. We believe that a coffin can be
              simple, beautiful, and respectful of the environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each coffin is woven by hand by Olivia, an experienced basket maker and
              tutor, using willow grown on our small farm in Pembrokeshire. From
              planting and harvesting to weaving and finishing, every stage is
              carefully considered and carried out with care.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Our work is rooted in traditional rural craft, but guided by modern
              values: sustainability, transparency, and personal service. We work
              closely with families and funeral directors to ensure everything feels
              calm, straightforward, and supportive at a difficult time.

        <p class="lead">
          All of our coffins are made using natural, renewable materials chosen for
          their beauty, strength, and environmental credentials.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">

            <h3>Willow</h3>
            <p>
              Willow is an exceptionally sustainable material. It grows quickly,
              regenerates after harvest, and can be woven without the need for
              industrial processing or heavy machinery.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our willow is grown and harvested on our Pembrokeshire farm, where soil
              and climate influence the colour and character of each rod. We select
              varieties specifically suited to coffin weaving, ensuring strength,
              flexibility, and a refined finish.
            </p>

            <p>
              To meet demand and to provide specialist buff and white willow, we also
              work with trusted growers in Somerset who share our commitment to
              quality and sustainability.
            </p>

            <h3>Construction and Finish</h3>

            <p>
              Coffins are available with either an all-willow woven base or an OSB base
              where required by crematoria.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each coffin is finished with natural rope handles, wooden toggles, and an
              unbleached cotton lining. No plastics, varnishes, or synthetic fabrics
              are used.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fully biodegradable, our coffins are suitable for natural burial grounds
              as well as conventional burial and cremation.
            </p>

        <p class="lead">
          We offer curved willow coffins in a small, carefully considered range of
          natural finishes.
        </p>

        <p>
          All coffins are suitable for natural and conventional burial, as well as
          cremation. We supply directly to families and through partnered funeral
          directors.
        </p>

        <p>
          As willow is a natural material, colour and texture will vary subtly
          depending on season and variety. These variations are part of what makes
          each coffin unique.
