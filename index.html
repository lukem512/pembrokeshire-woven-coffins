        <h2 id="about">About Pembrokeshire Woven Coffins</h2>
        <p class="lead">Grown and woven by hand here in Wales</p>
        <div class="two-col-lg">
          <div>
            <p>
              Pembrokeshire Woven Coffins was founded to offer families a meaningful alternative to mass-produced coffins.
              We believe that a coffin can be simple, beautiful, and respectful of the environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each coffin is woven by hand by Liv, an experienced basket maker and tutor, using willow grown on our small farm in Pembrokeshire.
            </p>

            <p>
              Liv came to weaving coffins through a love of people, the natural world, and her love for willow basketry.
              She hopes to create a calm and supportive space for people to feel connected to their loved ones by being as involved in the coffin making process as they wish.
              From planting or harvesting willow, to design ideas and participating in the weaving, families and friends are welcome to visit.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Our work is guided by our desire to have a light touch on the planet whilst building strong and impactful connections with the community.
              We work closely with families and funeral directors to ensure everything feels calm, straightforward and supportive at a difficult time.

        <h2 id="materials">Sustainable Materials</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          All of our coffins are made using natural, renewable materials chosen for
          their beauty, strength, and environmental credentials.
        </p>

        <div class="two-col">

            <h3>Willow</h3>
            <p>
              Willow is an exceptionally sustainable material.
              It grows quickly and regenerates after harvest, meaning that the tree remains alive whilst its timber can still be used.
            </p>

            <p>
              All of the willow from our Pembrokeshire small holding has been planted, harvested, graded and woven by hand.
              There is no need for industrial processing or heavy machinery.
            </p>

            <p>
              To meet demand and to provide specialist buff and white willow, additional willow is purchased from a family farm in Somerset and an independent grower in Swansea.
            </p>

            <h3>Local Timber</h3>

            <p>
              The lid for each coffin is supported by a framework of locally-sourced timber.
              We work closely with a a local sawmill, using logs grown in Pembrokeshire or the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Lining</h3>

            <p>
              All of our coffins are double-lined: first with a biodegradable cornstarch and finished in a beautiful calico cotton.
              The calico is undyed to preserve the natural colour and texture of the fabric, provising a clean and elegant finish.
              Each lid is finished in the same calico fabric as the body of the coffin.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Base</h3>

            <p>
              Our coffins are made with an OSB base (a board made by compressing wooden fibers).
              This is incredibly strong and, once weaving is complete, is not visible from the side. 
            </p>

            <p>
              We are able to provide a woven base at an extra cost for a fully natural option.
              Our woven bases are made using willow and a locally-sourced timber framework.
              Please note that woven bases are not compatible with cremation but may be required by some natural burial grounds.
              We are able to advise you and to communicate with burial grounds to decide which option is best for each circumstance.
            </p>

            <p>Both woven and OSB bases are fully biodegradable.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>

            <p>
              Coffins are available with either an OSB base or an all-willow woven base
              for a fully natural option (which may be required by some natural burial grounds).
            </p>

            <p>
              Each coffin is finished with natural rope handles and handmade wooden togglesm fastened using hemp cord. No plastics, varnishes, or synthetic fabrics
              are used.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fully biodegradable, our coffins are suitable for natural burial grounds
              as well as conventional burial and cremation.
            </p>

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Are willow coffins suitable for cremation?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Our willow coffins are made with an OSB base that meets crematorium requirements.</p>

        <h3>How long does a willow coffin take to make?</h3>
        <p>
          Our coffins take up to 3 days to make.
          However, the willow needs to be soaked for up to a week before weaving so please allow a total time of up to 10 days.
          We also keep a small stock of coffins ready to order.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the benefits of choosing a willow coffin?</h3>
        <p>
          Our willow coffins are extremely environmentally friendly and are using completely biodegradable materials, making them suitable for natural burial.
          The willow used in our coffins is grown in the UK and the coffins are handwoven here in Pembrokeshire, resulting in a very small carbon footprint.
          We also believe that willow coffins are incredibly beautiful!
        </p>

        <h3>Do you supply funeral directors?</h3>
        <p>We work directly with families and with funeral directors across Pembrokeshire and Wales.</p>

        <h3>How much does a willow coffin cost?</h3>
        <p>Our coffins start from £750.</p>

        <h3>Can I plan ahead?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Many people choose to plan ahead, and we are happy to discuss options without pressure.</p>

        <h3>Can you see through a woven coffin?</h3>
        <p>No. Our coffins are double-lined with biodegradable cornstarch and unbleached, natural calico cotton to ensure a clean and professional finish.</p>
